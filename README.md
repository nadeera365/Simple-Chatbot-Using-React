# Simple Chatbot Using React

This is a **simple chatbot web app** built using **React.js**, following the *“React Tutorial Full Course – Beginner to Pro”* by **SuperSimpleDev**.  
It demonstrates how React handles **state**, **components**, **props**, and **event handling**, while creating an interactive chatbot interface.

## 🚀 Features

- 💬 Real-time chat between user and bot  
- ⚙️ Uses `useState` and `useEffect` React hooks  
- 🧠 AI-like responses from a simple chatbot API  
- ⌨️ Send messages by pressing **Enter**  
- ❌ Clear input by pressing **Escape**

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **React.js** (via CDN)
- **Babel** (for JSX transformation)
- **HTML5 & CSS3**
- **SuperSimpleDev Chatbot API**

---

## 🧰 How It Works

1. The app has three main React components:
   - `ChatInput` → handles user input and sending messages  
   - `ChatMessage` → displays individual messages (user or robot)  
   - `ChatMessages` → renders all chat messages and auto-scrolls  

2. When a user sends a message:
   - The message is added to state (`chatMessages`)  
   - The chatbot API (`Chatbot.getResponseAsync`) generates a reply  
   - Both messages are displayed in the chat window
